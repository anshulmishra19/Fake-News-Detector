# Fake-News-Detector
Built a Python-based Fake News Detector with machine learning techniques.

Description :
Developed a Fake News Detector using Python and various libraries including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NLTK, WordCloud, and Scikit-learn.

Implemented a machine learning model with a 70% accuracy rate in detecting fake news, utilizing data processing and visualization tools.

Deployed the application using Streamlit, and ensured model persistence with Pickle for efficient real-time predictions.

Libraries: 
 
The TweetSent Analyzer leverages various libraries for different stages of the sentiment analysis process:
• NumPy and Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and exploration, these libraries are essential for loading and exploring Twitter datasets.
• Matplotlib: These visualization library are employed for creating plots that depict sentiment distribution and entity-sentiment relationships.
• NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): NLTK is crucial for text preprocessing tasks, including tokenization and stopwords removal.
• WordCloud: Utilized for generating word clouds that visually represent the most frequent words in tweets for each sentiment and top entities.
• Scikit-learn: This library is used for machine learning tasks, including training a Random Forest classifier, vectorizing text data, and evaluating the model's performance.
• Streamlit: Employed for developing the web application component, Streamlit facilitates the creation of a user-friendly interface for real-time news detections.
• Pickle: The pickle module is used for implementing binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.
